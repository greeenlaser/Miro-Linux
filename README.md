# Miro on Linux

The purpose of this program is to bring Miro to Linux (targeted to Arch and Arch-likes but should work on all others) and to allow using [miro](httpos://miro.com) natively on Linux via a Desktop app because they haven't done one so far for whatever reason.

This program relies on [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/) and a few other dependencies that have been listed in the[quick setup doc](quick-setup.md).

The developers and maintainers of this program are not affiliated in any way with Miro, this is simply an unofficial project for personal use.
